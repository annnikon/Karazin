THINGS TODO (mostly in order of importance)

* Optimize for IE

* More localizations
  
* Prettier initial styles, especially for non-Safari browsers
  - Just get the reset button generation out of there
  - Maybe do hidden inputs for the generated field defaults

* iPhone optimization

* Never too late for code CLEANUP and optimizations

* [?] Range options: minrange, defaultrange (do minrange and defaultrange
  make sense?)
